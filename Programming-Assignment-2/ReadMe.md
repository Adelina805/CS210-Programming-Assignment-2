Read Me:
Read Me must be a PDF
Devise an algorithm to convert a BST to a balanced BST, ignoring the insert and delete
methods, your algorithm must run to an O(n) time.
You need not implement the above algorithm in your code but write the pseudocode for it in
Read Me and explain the algorithm in detail.
The following must be included in the read me for the method above:
1. ReturnType methodName (arguments)
2. Brief description of the method and how it works.
3. Pre and Post conditions of the method
4. Pseudo code of the method
5. Proof that your algorithm runs to O(N) time
   No other classes or methods need to be explained in the read me.
